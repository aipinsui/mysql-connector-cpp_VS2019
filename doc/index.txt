MySQL Connector/C++ Documentation  {#mainpage}
==============================================

MySQL Connector/C++ is a library for applications written in C or C++ that
communicate with MySQL database servers. Version 8 of Connector/C++
implements three different APIs which can be used by applications:

- The [X DevAPI](@ref devapi_example) for applications written in C++.

- The [X DevAPI for C](@ref xapi_example) for applications written
  in plain C.

- The [classic JDBC4-based API](@ref jdbc_example) that was also implemented
  in earlier versions of the connector.

X DevAPI and X DevAPI for C give access to MySQL implementing a
[document store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/document-store.html).
Internally these APIs use the X Protocol to communicate with the MySQL
Server. Consequently, code written against these APIs can work only with MySQL
Server 8 or later. Apart from accessing the document store, these APIs allow
executing traditional SQL queries as well.
The classic JDBC4-based API, on the other hand, uses the classic protocol and
can communicate with older versions of the MySQL Server. It can work only with
SQL queries and does not support CRUD operations over the document store.
The API to be used is chosen by including appropriate set of headers, as
explained in @ref usage.
