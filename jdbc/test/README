Disclaimer: yes, running our tests is annoying, yes, we have
put "make test" (or similar) functionality on our TODO. However,
for the moment have a look at the following notes:

All tests support the option --verbose for verbose output. Verbose really
 means verbose. If you want to run all tests  for code coverage checks,
turn verbose output on to maximize coverage.

Also, for code coverage, make sure you use:

  cmake -DMYSQLCPPCONN_TEST_NOT_IMPLEMENTED:BOOL=1 \
        -DMYSQLCPPCONN_GCOV_ENABLE:BOOL=1 \
        -DMYSQLCPPCONN_BUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=1

To run all tests:

test/CJUnitTestsPort/CJUnitTestsPort --verbose ; test/driver_test --verbose ; test/static_test --verbose ;  examples/connect --verbose ;  examples/connection_meta_schemaobj --verbose ; examples/debug
--verbose ; examples/dynamic_load --verbose ;  examples/exceptions --verbose ;  examples/prepared_statement --verbose ;  examples/resultset --verbose ; examples/resultset_binary --verbose ;
examples/resultset_meta --verbose ; examples/resultset_types --verbose ; examples/statement --verbose ; test/unit/classes/art_resultset --verbose ;  test/unit/classes/connection --verbose ;
test/unit/classes/databasemetadata --verbose ; test/unit/classes/parametermetadata --verbose ; test/unit/classes/preparedstatement --verbose ;  test/unit/classes/resultset --verbose ;
test/unit/classes/resultsetmetadata --verbose ; test/unit/classes/savepoint --verbose ;  test/unit/classes/statement
